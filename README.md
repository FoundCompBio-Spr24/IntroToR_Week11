# Introduction to R

## What is R?

- R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
- R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, …) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible.
- R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display.
- One of R’s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced.
